Consensus:

In the blockchain, a consensus mechanism is a system that validates a transaction and marks it as authentic. This mechanism lists all valid transactions of a coin in a blockchain to build trust in the coin among traders. Several currencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum etc., use this system for security purposes

Types of Consensus:

PROOF OF WORK VS PROOF OF STACK :

Proof-of-Work (POW) uses a competitive validation method to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain

Proof-of-Stake (POS) uses randomly selected validators to confirm transactions and create new blocks

Scalability of blockchain networks is the ability of that platform to support increasing load of transactions, as well as increasing the number of nodes in the network.

Sharding is a process that divides the whole network of a blockchain organization into several smaller networks, referred to as "shards." Because it contains data that is unique to it, one shard stands out as unique and independent of other shards.

Layer 1 blockchains utilize methods such as changing the consensus mechanism, forking the chain, and sharding.

Layer 2 scaling solutions exist as state channels, nested blockchains, rollups, and sidechains
