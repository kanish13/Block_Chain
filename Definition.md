Smart Contract:

They are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized of third party intermediary.

* Cannot be altered

* Automatically 

* Everyone sees the term of agreement

Hybrid Smart Contract:

Hybrid smart contracts combine code running on the blockchain (on-chain) with data and computation from outside the blockchain (off-chain) provided by decentralized oracle networks.

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that establishes a peer-to-peer network that securely executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts.

Chainlink is a decentralized blockchain oracle network built on Ethereum. The network is intended to be used to facilitate the transfer of tamper-proof data from off-chain sources to on-chain smart contracts

DeFi = Decentralized Finanace

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a new financial paradigm that leverages distributed ledger technologies to offer services such as lending, investing, or exchanging cryptoassets without relying on a traditional centralized intermediary.

DAO = Decentralized Autonomous Organization 

A decentralized autonomous organization, sometimes called a decentralized autonomous corporation, is an organization constructed by rules encoded as a computer program that is often transparent, controlled by the organization's members and not influenced by a central government.

NFT = non-fungible tokens 

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital identifier that is recorded on a blockchain, and is used to certify ownership and authenticity.

Gas is the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform

Consensus is the mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain

Each block node contains all the transaction details
