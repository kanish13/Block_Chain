* Hash: Hashing is the transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.
* Hash Algorithm: A function that computes data into a uniques hash
* Mining : The process of finding the solution to blockchain problems . Nodes get paid for mining blocks.
* Block : A list of transactions mined together
* Decentralized : Having no single point of authority
* Nonce : A number used once to find the solution to the blockchain problem . It is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address

* Click on Hash option in the navigation bar:

If you see it is mentioned as SHA256 Hash . SHA-256 stands for Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit and it's used for cryptographic security . This creates the hash for everything you type in data section .But whatever data you are going to enter irrespective of the length , the total length of the hash value is not going to change

* Next click on blockchain in navigation bar :

Here you can see the list of block that are connected to eachother . But if you change data in any of the block its going to affect all the successor:

In this example you can see i changed the data in Block 4 . Block 4 and Block 5 afftected . It is represented in red colour.

To get that back to normal , mine both the block
